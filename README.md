# Should people subtitute traditional gas cars with electric vehicles?
In this document, I discuss two articles about why should people substitute traditional gas cars with electric cars and why people are still holding back about electric cars. I present and discuss two opposing views about electric cars and their influence on enviornment and people's daily life. 

## Article 1
In NYT's [Electric Cars Are Better for the Planet – and Often Your Budget, Too](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/15/climate/electric-car-cost.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article), several reasons that people should adopt electric cars are introduced. Firstly, the electric cars are more climate friendly. According to the data calculated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the average carbon dioxide emissions per mile of electric cars (calculated to be lower than 300 grams per mile) is much lower than traditional gas-powered cars, diesel cars, and hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Since the emissions, which mostly come from vehicles, are the largest source of global warming issue, substituting traditional gas cars with electric ones would definitely help solve the problem. New technologies are continually introduced. Driving cleaner cars is ultimately beneficial to human in the long run. 

Another reason why people should buy electric cars instead of traditional ones is that despite the high price listed on the price tags of electric cars, the full lifetime cost of electric cars is the cheapest compared to 3 other kinds of cars. According to the data, electric cars have the lowest average cost per month over time because of the lower costs of maintenance and charging. Besides, while the gas price can vary a lot because of various reasons, the price of electricity seems to be much stabler. 

## Article 2
In World Economic Forum's [4 reasons why electric cars haven’t taken off yet](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/electric-cars-batteries-fossil-fuel/), 4 reasons why people are still holding back about electric cars are presented. Firstly, some people argue that the upfront price of electric cars is still too high. 

Secondly, there are no enough chargers to keep electric cars on the road. According to the IEA, in 2020, the highest ratio of public chargers per EV stock across the world has not reached 0.5, and most countries have ratio less than 0.1. 

Thirdly, there has been a shortage of microchips due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, which led to the low availability of electric cars. 

Last but not least, people are still questioning the reliability of electric vehicles. Although there is no clear evidence, people express worries about battery fires and the safety of battery technology.

With the development of battery technology and decreasing price of batteries, I believe the electric vehicles would become more and more popular.
